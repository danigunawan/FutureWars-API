# Futurewars

Futurewars is a text-based game modeled on the old Tradewars 2002 BBS game, written in Ruby & Rails.

> late 1980s for Bulletin Board Systems. For 25 years, it has been 
> actively played by a devoted community of gameops and players. It is a 
> seminal game, credited as an early inspiration by many of today’s game
> developers.
